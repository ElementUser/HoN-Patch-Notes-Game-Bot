# HoN Patch Notes Guessing Game (Bot)

![Build](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/ElementUser/HoN-Patch-Notes-Game-Bot/Github%20CI?label=Build%3A%20Github%20CI&style=flat-square)

This application automates the process of HoN's Patch Notes Guessing Game that is hosted in a thread on the Reddit platform.

Specifically, the bot is intended to create a thread in the [/r/heroesofnewerth subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesofNewerth/).

Reddit users post their guess according to the [Rules of the game](#Rules-of-the-game).

To skip to Bot Usage directly, go to the [Requirements section](#Requirements).

## Rules of the Game

- Pick a number between 1 and `max_line_count`, and post that number to the main thread or the comment that /u/hon-bot responds to you with.
- Guesses for lines that actually have content in the patch notes are considered "valid guesses", and the user will be entered into the pool of potential winners for a prize if they get a valid guess! See the Rewards section for more information.
- Each user gets `max_num_guesses` guesses until they run out of guesses.
- If your guess has a number in it in your first line of your comment, it WILL be parsed by the bot and will count as a guess (whether you want it to or not). For simplicity's sake, please only include a number in your guess.
- Guesses for line numbers that don't exist in the patch notes count as an invalid guess. You have been warned!
- There are invalid lines in the patch notes. These are blank lines, and lines with separator elements like `_______` and `-------`.
  - If you guess an invalid line, you will receive a `Whiffed!` comment response. Your number of guesses remaining will reduce by 1 when this occurs, and you will no longer be able to participate if this number reaches 0.
- PLEASE USE CTRL+F or the search feature IF YOUR NUMBER HAS BEEN GUESSED. A guess with a number that has already been guessed will count as an invalid guess.

## The Bot

The bot enforces these rules and outputs various text lines from a given `patch_notes.txt` file, depending on if a user guesses a line with the appropriate number of content or not. Some features/behaviours that the bot will encompass:

- Log into Reddit (credentials are configured in `hon_patch_notes_game_bot/praw.ini`) and communicate with its API at fixed time intervals
- Keep track of each unique user that responds to the bot in the thread and/or to a comment that the bot made in the thread
- Keep track of these user's statistics pertaining to the current game instance
- Prevent Reddit accounts that are too new or below a certain comment karma from commenting
- Creates a second Reddit thread where it keeps track of the correctly guessed patch note lines & fills in the content for the public to view

# Requirements

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/) or higher must be installed on the host system.
  - If installing Python 3.8 or higher on Linux, follow the directions [here](https://tecadmin.net/install-python-3-8-ubuntu/)

# Setup

- Log onto the bot's Reddit account at: https://www.reddit.com/login/
- Set up a Reddit app by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example), and obtain your app's `client_id` and `client_secret` (required for next step)
- Create a `praw.ini` file in this directory: `hon_patch_notes_game_bot/praw.ini`.

Configure `praw.ini` with your bot credentials so it looks like this:

```
[insertBotNameHere]
client_id=insert_client_id_here
client_secret=insert_client_secret_here
password=insert_bot_password_here
username=insert_bot_username_here
```

Using a `praw.ini` file is a secure way to provide the login credentials for PRAW in the bot script. `.ini` files are not committed to source control (as defined in `.gitignore`). [praw.ini reference](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html)

- Install Poetry by following the installation steps [from their official documents](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). Do not use `pip install` to install Poetry.
- `Mac/Linux`: After installation, on Mac/Linux you must run this command to enable the poetry command in your terminal: `source $HOME/.poetry/env`
- Update Poetry to the latest version by running this command: `poetry self update --preview`
  - Poetry is required to handle dependencies in a virtualenv & run the script in a consistent environment regardless of the host system.

## Development - Extra Steps

To ensure that the proper libraries and modules are used, use the Python interpreter `python.exe` found in the virtualenv generated by Poetry. This can be found by running `poetry shell` in the terminal, navigating to the path, and then having your IDE select the `python.exe` file in that directory as the Python interpreter.

When run through the virtual environment, `praw.ini` will not be detected in the current working directory. To resolve this, you have a few options:

- If developing on Windows: copy `praw.ini` to `%APPDATA%` (recommended)
- Copying `praw.ini` to the virtualenv folder (not recommended)
- On other systems, please follow the instructions in the official documentation here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html#praw-ini-files

## Mac/Linux - Additional Setup

- Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal and run `stat scripts.sh` to check its permissions. This file must have execute permissions (the "x" flag set) to run properly.
- If required, use `chmod 744 scripts.sh` (assuming the current account is the owner of the file) to set file permissions properly.

# Usage

Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.

- To run the script, use `./scripts.sh start`
- To run unit tests, use `./scripts.sh test`
- To reset the cache & database, use `./scripts.sh reset` before running `./scripts.sh start`
- To pick a list of winners from the existing local database, use `./scripts.sh winners 20`, where the "20" can be replaced with an integer to specify the number of winners picked

## More Usage Notes

For unreleased patch notes, **do not commit and push the branch to source control before their official release**.

To change up some commonly changed configuration before starting a new run, go to `hon_patch_notes_game_bot/config/config.py` and edit them.
