It's time for the HoN Patch Notes guessing game again!

# Rules of the Game

- Pick a number between 1 and 661.

- Each person gets 1 (ONE) guess. As I see each reply myself and/or /u/elementuser will look up that line on the notes and let you know exactly what it says.

- Use your collective knowledge and put together the patch notes early!

- Don't ruin the fun for others. Don't be rude or a jerk.

- There are lines that are [blank] (Whiff). If you receive a [blank] (whiff) response, you have 1 (ONE) more additional guess, [blank] or (whiff) again and you're out!

- Gold randomly selected x10.

- PLEASE USE CTRL+F, or the search feature IF YOUR NUMBER HAS BEEN ASKED. They will not count as a valid entry!

GL HF!
