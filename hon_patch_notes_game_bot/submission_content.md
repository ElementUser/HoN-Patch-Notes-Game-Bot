It's time for the HoN Patch Notes guessing game again!

HoN Patch Version: `patch_version`

## Rules of the Game (Bot Operations)

- Pick a number between 1 and `max_line_count`, and post that number to the main thread or the comment that /u/hon-bot responds to you with.
- Guesses for lines that actually have content in the patch notes will be entered into a pool of potential winners for a prize! See the [Rewards](#Rewards) section for more information.
- Each person gets 1 (ONE) guess. If your guess has a number in it in your first line of your comment, it WILL be parsed by the bot and will count as a guess (whether you want it to or not). For simplicity's sake, please only include a number in your guess.
- Guesses for line numbers that don't exist in the patch notes count as an invalid guess. You have been warned!
- There are blank lines in the patch notes. If you guess a blank line, you will receive a `Whiffed!` comment. You have 1 (ONE) more additional guess.
- PLEASE USE CTRL+F or the search feature IF YOUR NUMBER HAS BEEN GUESSED. They will not count as a valid entry, and you will instantly be disqualified if you choose a number that has already been guessed.

## Other Rules

- Use your collective knowledge and put together the patch notes early!
- Don't ruin the fun for others. Don't be rude or a jerk.
- Note that the patch notes published here are subject to change at any time after this game has been set live. However, they are unlikely to change much (if at all).
- To prevent spam from throwaway accounts, this bot will not respond to accounts that are below a certain comment karma threshold.

## Rewards

- 10 Lucky Winners from the pool of potential winners will receive 200 Gold Coins each.
- Winners will be announced in this thread when the game ends.
- You will receive a message from /u/S2Sliferjam/ if you have been chosen!
