It's time for the HoN Patch Notes guessing game again!

HoN Patch Version: `patch_version`

## Rules of the Game

- Pick a number between 1 and `max_line_count`, and post that number to the main thread or the comment that /u/hon-bot responds to you with.
- Guesses for lines that actually have content in the patch notes will be entered into the pool of potential winners for a prize! See the Rewards section for more information.
- Each person gets 1 (ONE) guess. If your guess has a number in it in your first line of your comment, it WILL be parsed by the bot and will count as a guess (whether you want it to or not). For simplicity's sake, please only include a number in your guess.
- Guesses for line numbers that don't exist in the patch notes count as an invalid guess. You have been warned!
- There are blank lines in the patch notes. If you guess a blank line, you will receive a `Whiffed!` comment response. You have 1 (ONE) more additional guess.
- PLEASE USE CTRL+F or the search feature IF YOUR NUMBER HAS BEEN GUESSED. A guess with a number that has already been guessed will count as an invalid guess.

## Other Rules

- Use your collective knowledge and put together the patch notes early!
- Don't ruin the fun for others. Don't be rude or a jerk.
- Note that the patch notes published here are subject to change at any time after this game has been set live. However, they are unlikely to change much (if at all).
- To prevent spam from throwaway accounts, this bot will not respond to accounts that are below a certain comment karma threshold or that have been created too recently.

## Rewards

- 10 Lucky Winners from the pool of potential winners will receive 200 Gold Coins each.
- Winners will be announced in this thread when the game ends.
- You will receive a message from /u/S2Sliferjam if you have been chosen!

## Community-compiled Patch Notes Thread

This bot now has a feature where it auto-updates the community-compiled patch notes in real-time. Unfortunately, doing so in the same thread as this one would make all users have to scroll down for far too long.

Therefore, a separate Reddit thread has been created for the community-compiled Patch Notes Thread.
